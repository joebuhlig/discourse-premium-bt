## Discourse Premium BT

This is a plugin for [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) that creates a paywall for access to a group. You can then create private categories for the group and effectively create a premium section of the community.

To use it, you'll need an account with [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com). For testing purposes you can create a sandbox account. It's no fun testing with real money.

### Set up

1. In Braintree, create a new Plan. This is where you set the price and billing intervals.
